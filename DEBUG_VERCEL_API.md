# 🔧 Debugging Vercel Production API Issue

## 🚨 Problem
Production build on Vercel is trying to connect to `http://localhost:5000` instead of the Vercel domain.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Environment Detection
- Added Vercel domain detection (`.vercel.app`, `.vercel.com`)
- More robust development vs production mode detection
- Detailed logging of environment variables

### 2. Removed Conflicting Environment Variables
- Removed `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000` from `.env`
- This was potentially causing conflicts

### 3. Added Request Debugging
- Added axios request interceptor to log all API calls
- Will show exactly which URL is being called and why

### 4. Fixed Build Dependencies ✅ SOLVED
- **ROOT CAUSE #1**: Missing `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` dependencies
- Added both packages to `devDependencies` in `package.json`
- Vercel build was failing before it could even test the API URLs

### 5. Fixed Vercel Function Limit ✅ SOLVED  
- **ROOT CAUSE #2**: Exceeded Vercel Hobby plan limit of 12 serverless functions
- Consolidated 13 individual functions into 3 main handlers:
  - `/api/auth.js` - Handles all authentication (login, register, profile, verify)
  - `/api/favorites.js` - Handles all favorites operations (CRUD with query params)
  - `/api/health.js` - Health check endpoint
- Updated frontend to use consolidated endpoints with query parameters

### 6. Enhanced Request Interception
- Added global axios interceptor to catch and fix any `localhost:5000` calls
- Added global fetch interceptor as backup
- Both will automatically replace `localhost:5000` with current domain

### 7. Fixed Hardcoded localhost References
- Fixed `ApiTest.jsx` component that had hardcoded `localhost:5000`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Vercel
Push these changes to GitHub (they will auto-deploy to Vercel):
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Enhanced API environment detection and debugging"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Check Vercel Logs
1. Open your Vercel dashboard
2. Go to your project deployment
3. Open browser dev tools (F12)
4. Look for console logs showing:
   ```
   🔍 Environment Detection: { isDev: false, mode: 'production', ... }
   🚀 Production mode detected, using current origin: https://your-app.vercel.app
   🌐 Axios Request: { url: '/api/auth/login', baseURL: undefined, fullURL: '/api/auth/login' }
   ```

### 3. Verify Environment Variables in Vercel
Make sure these are set in your Vercel dashboard:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Your JWT secret key
- `NODE_ENV` - Should be `production`

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Expected Behavior:
- Console should show "Production mode detected"
- API calls should go to `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/...`
- No `localhost:5000` references

### If Still Failing:
- Check if there's browser caching (try incognito mode)
- Look for any remaining `localhost:5000` references in dev tools
- Check Vercel function logs for errors

## 📋 Current Status:
✅ Build working locally  
✅ Enhanced environment detection  
✅ Debugging added  
✅ Conflicting env vars removed  
✅ **CRITICAL**: Fixed missing build dependencies (`tailwindcss`, `autoprefixer`)
✅ **CRITICAL**: Consolidated API functions to stay within Vercel 12-function limit
✅ Global request interception to block/fix localhost calls
✅ Hardcoded localhost references removed
🚀 **DEPLOYED**: Latest changes pushed to main branch, Vercel should rebuild automatically

## 🎯 Expected Result:
The Vercel deployment should now:
1. ✅ Build successfully (dependencies fixed)
2. ✅ Stay within function limits (3 consolidated functions vs 13 individual)
3. ✅ Use correct API URLs in production (environment detection + interceptors)
4. ✅ Work end-to-end without localhost errors

## 🔧 Architecture Changes Made:
**Before**: 13 individual serverless functions (exceeded limit)
- `/api/auth/login.js`, `/api/auth/register.js`, `/api/auth/profile.js`, `/api/auth/verify.js`
- `/api/favorites/index.js`, `/api/favorites/[word].js`, `/api/favorites/add.js`, etc.

**After**: 3 consolidated serverless functions (within limit)
- `/api/auth.js?action=login|register|profile|verify`
- `/api/favorites.js?action=get|add|delete|check&word=X&id=Y`
- `/api/health.js`
