# 🔧 Debugging Vercel Production API Issue

## 🚨 Problem
Production build on Vercel is trying to connect to `http://localhost:5000` instead of the Vercel domain.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Environment Detection
- Added Vercel domain detection (`.vercel.app`, `.vercel.com`)
- More robust development vs production mode detection
- Detailed logging of environment variables

### 2. Removed Conflicting Environment Variables
- Removed `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000` from `.env`
- This was potentially causing conflicts

### 3. Added Request Debugging
- Added axios request interceptor to log all API calls
- Will show exactly which URL is being called and why

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Vercel
Push these changes to GitHub (they will auto-deploy to Vercel):
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Enhanced API environment detection and debugging"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Check Vercel Logs
1. Open your Vercel dashboard
2. Go to your project deployment
3. Open browser dev tools (F12)
4. Look for console logs showing:
   ```
   🔍 Environment Detection: { isDev: false, mode: 'production', ... }
   🚀 Production mode detected, using current origin: https://your-app.vercel.app
   🌐 Axios Request: { url: '/api/auth/login', baseURL: undefined, fullURL: '/api/auth/login' }
   ```

### 3. Verify Environment Variables in Vercel
Make sure these are set in your Vercel dashboard:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Your JWT secret key
- `NODE_ENV` - Should be `production`

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Expected Behavior:
- Console should show "Production mode detected"
- API calls should go to `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/...`
- No `localhost:5000` references

### If Still Failing:
- Check if there's browser caching (try incognito mode)
- Look for any remaining `localhost:5000` references in dev tools
- Check Vercel function logs for errors

## 📋 Current Status:
✅ Build working locally  
✅ Enhanced environment detection  
✅ Debugging added  
✅ Conflicting env vars removed  
🔄 Ready for Vercel deployment testing

The enhanced debugging will help us pinpoint exactly where the `localhost:5000` call is coming from!
